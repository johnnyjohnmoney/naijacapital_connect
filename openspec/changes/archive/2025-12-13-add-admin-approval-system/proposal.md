## Why

The NaijaCapital Connect platform currently allows business owners to publish investment opportunities directly without any oversight, creating significant risks:

1. **Fraud Prevention**: No mechanism to verify legitimacy of business proposals before they reach investors
2. **Quality Control**: No filtering for incomplete, misleading, or low-quality investment opportunities
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: No way to enforce platform policies or prevent prohibited business types
4. **User Safety**: Investors exposed to unvetted opportunities with potential scams or fraudulent schemes
5. **Platform Liability**: No audit trail or administrative oversight of published opportunities

Currently, the admin dashboard has placeholder tabs with mock data and limited functionality. This change implements a comprehensive admin approval workflow and management system to establish proper platform governance.

**Business Impact:**

- Reduces fraud risk and protects investor capital
- Builds trust in the platform through quality assurance
- Provides regulatory compliance foundation
- Enables data-driven platform management decisions
- Creates accountability for business owners

## What Changes

**Phase 1: Opportunity Approval Workflow (Critical)**

- Add new opportunity statuses: `PENDING_REVIEW`, `NEEDS_REVISION`, `REJECTED`, `SUSPENDED`, `FEATURED`
- Modify Business model with approval workflow fields: `reviewedBy`, `reviewedAt`, `rejectionReason`, `adminNotes`, `revisionRequests`, `isFeatured`
- Update opportunity creation to default to `PENDING_REVIEW` status
- Build Admin Opportunity Review interface with filtering and bulk actions
- Create admin API endpoints for approve/reject/request-changes actions
- Implement email notifications for opportunity status changes
- Add opportunity viewing restriction (only `OPEN` visible to investors)

**Phase 2: User Management**

- Add user account actions: suspend, unsuspend, verify, ban
- Add `suspended`, `bannedAt`, `banReason`, `verificationNotes` fields to User model
- Build User Management interface with search, filters, and user detail views
- Create admin API endpoints for user account management
- Track admin actions in audit log
- Implement email notifications for account actions

**Phase 3: Compliance & Moderation**

- Add ReportedContent model for user reports on opportunities/users
- Add ComplianceFlag model for automated suspicious activity detection
- Build compliance dashboard with flagged content and resolution workflow
- Create API endpoints for report management and resolution
- Add automated flagging rules (multiple failed investments, unusual patterns)

**Phase 4: Financial Oversight**

- Add WithdrawalApproval model extending WithdrawalRequest
- Build financial oversight dashboard with transaction monitoring
- Create withdrawal approval workflow for admin review
- Add commission tracking and revenue analytics
- Implement refund and dispute management

**Phase 5: System Configuration**

- Add PlatformSettings model for configurable platform parameters
- Build system configuration interface
- Add audit log for all admin actions (AdminAuditLog model)
- Implement feature flags and email template customization

**Out of Scope (Future Enhancements):**

- Multi-admin approval requirements (2-factor approval)
- Automated fraud detection with ML
- Advanced KYC document verification
- Payment gateway integration
- Two-factor authentication for admins
- IP whitelist restrictions
- Advanced analytics dashboards

## Impact

**Affected Capabilities:**

- Opportunity Management (approval workflow added)
- User Management (account controls added)
- Administrative Controls (new comprehensive admin features)
- Notifications (new notification types for approvals)
- Database Schema (multiple model additions and modifications)
- Dashboard UI (complete admin dashboard rebuild)

**Affected Code:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add new enums, models, and fields
- `src/app/api/opportunities/route.ts` - Default to PENDING_REVIEW status
- `src/app/api/opportunities/[id]/route.ts` - Filter by status
- `src/components/dashboards/AdministratorDashboard.tsx` - Complete rebuild
- New files:
  - `src/app/api/admin/opportunities/[id]/approve/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/opportunities/[id]/reject/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/opportunities/[id]/request-changes/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/suspend/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/verify/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/withdrawals/[id]/approve/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/reports/route.ts`
  - `src/components/admin/OpportunityReviewPanel.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/OpportunityDetailModal.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/UserManagementPanel.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/CompliancePanel.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/FinancialOversightPanel.tsx`
  - `src/lib/email-templates.ts`
  - `src/lib/admin-audit.ts`

**Breaking Changes:**

- **BREAKING**: Existing opportunities in database need migration to PENDING_REVIEW or OPEN status
- **BREAKING**: Business owners can no longer publish opportunities directly (must wait for approval)
- **BREAKING**: Investor opportunity list will only show OPEN opportunities (previously showed all)

**Migration Path:**

1. Run database migration to add new fields and models
2. Update existing opportunities: `UPDATE businesses SET status = 'OPEN' WHERE status = 'OPEN' OR status IS NULL`
3. Add admin review notes to existing opportunities: `UPDATE businesses SET reviewedBy = 'SYSTEM', reviewedAt = NOW(), adminNotes = 'Auto-approved during migration'`
4. Deploy new API and UI code
5. Notify business owners of new approval process via email

**Risk Assessment:**

- **High**: Existing business owners may be frustrated by new approval requirement → Mitigate with clear communication and fast approval SLA (24-48 hours)
- **Medium**: Admin workload spike with backlog of pending opportunities → Mitigate with bulk approval actions and filtering
- **Low**: False positives in automated compliance flagging → Mitigate with manual review override capability
- **Low**: Data loss during migration → Mitigate with database backup before migration

**Dependencies:**

- Email service configured (SMTP or SendGrid)
- Admin accounts created with proper permissions
- Database backup capability for safe migration

**Timeline:**

- Phase 1 (Opportunity Approval): 4-5 days
- Phase 2 (User Management): 3-4 days
- Phase 3 (Compliance): 3-4 days
- Phase 4 (Financial Oversight): 3-4 days
- Phase 5 (System Configuration): 2-3 days
- Testing & Documentation: 3-4 days
- **Total**: 18-24 days (single developer, full-time)

**Success Metrics:**

- 100% of new opportunities go through approval workflow
- Average approval turnaround time < 48 hours
- <5% false positive rate on compliance flags
- Admin action audit log covers all critical operations
- Zero unauthorized opportunity publications
